<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>we are working for your Parking Solution<b>Park Friend</b>combines the two concepts in order to allow people to find the cheapest and most convenient parking available, 
no matter where they are or where they are going. Our crazy-about-parking (or maybe crazy-about-not-getting-parking-tickets!) 
users contribute information about street parking, parking meters, car parks and even private driveways that are for rent.</p>


<h3>How can I contribute?</h3><br>
<p>We hope that you find Park Freind useful and decide to help us make it even better by contributing to the online content as follows:<br>
1 rating and reviewing the locations where you parked before<br>
2 adding missing parking spaces<br>
3 adding parking related information about an area where you live or that you are familiar with<br><br>
</p>
<h4>Park Freind Community Guidelines</h4></br>

 rules which we urge you to follow:
